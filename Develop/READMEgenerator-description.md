For this assignment, I created a professional README.md for a project using JavaScript, node, and npm inquirer to prompt the user for their project details. Upon queueing the node, the user will follow a series of prompts, which will be written into the sections of the Readme document. The code is clearly marked with comments to delineate the sections of code and what they pertain to. I also added a bonus feature that will display the user's github username onto the bottom of the file.
